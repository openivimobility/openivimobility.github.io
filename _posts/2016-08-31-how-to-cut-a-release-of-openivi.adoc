The following steps will guide you through the process.

There's a stable branch in each of the following projects
  - rvi_sota_server
  - meta_oim
  - ota-plus-demo-provision

So the version that you want to release (latest master? older master plus a few cherrypicks), get the stable branch to be that. Then `git push` that branch to remote.

Now, from the `/pro` directory you can run:

```
cd .repo/manifests/
repo sync -m stable.xml
```

With the repositories are lined up, build a release with `bitbake`. From the `/pro` dir run:

```
cd poky
. oe-init-build-env
bitbake -k openivi-image
```

Now you should have your images in `build/tmp/deploy/images/genericx86-64/` with `genericx86-64` part possibly changing based on the architecture.

The image you are interested is probably one of:
- build/tmp/deploy/images/genericx86-64/openivi-image-genericx86-64.iso
- build/tmp/deploy/images/genericx86-64/openivi-image-genericx86-64.hddimg

If you want to share these, you can put them on s3 with the script `/meta-oim/scripts/release.sh`. There's instructions for its use at the top of the script, but the short version is:

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=abc123
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=def456
./poky/meta-oim/scripts/release.sh poky/build/tmp/deploy/images/genericx86-64/openivi-image-genericx86-64.iso
```

You'll then need to log onto s3 and make the files public, or give them whatever permissions are needed.

To burn these images to a disk, see the instructions for link:../developing/writing-images-to-microsd.html[writing images to a microSD card].
