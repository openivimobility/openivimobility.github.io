=== Open Hardware, Easy to Build

One of the most important goals of OpenIVI is to let you get an actual piece of hardware into a vehicle. To get you there, we provide a parts list that should help you build a test unit very quickly. We've tried to select parts that are reasonably priced, provide solid enough performance for a variety of applications, and are easily available for purchase.

You can also 3D print a case that will fit in a standard head unit slot. The project files for that are available over at the link:https://github.com/openivimobility/openivi-hardware[openivi-hardware repo].
